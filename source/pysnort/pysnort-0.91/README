pysnort. Python libraries for Snort IDS

pysnort is a set of libraries written in python and for python.
The main goal is to provide developers with a fast, easy to use, 
powerful and reliable program interface.

Up to now there's only a mysql log interface.
But this interface is powerful enough to let you build complete
applications without using a line of SQL.

Please, read test-pysnort.py for a tutorial.
Once you have the main ideas of the library, you can start reading
the documentation located in /doc directory.

Feel free to contact me for any doubt about it's use 
I will appreciate any suggestion, bug, feedback,etc.

Thanks for using pysnort!
